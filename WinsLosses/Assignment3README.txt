In my baseball team win loss percentage line chart, I decited to use value gradient to distinguish between multiple teams.
Each team is drawn using a stroke color of which the rgb is increased by 5 each iteration. 
This leads to a value difference of about 150 between the darkest and lightest teams.  
Because of this it is fairly easy to distinguish which lines lead to what ends even with lots of overlap. 
I chose to use a blue background and give each colored line a blue weighted grey color because most people can see blue,
and consistent use of hue and changing the value would allow the data to be pleasently viewable in black and white.
The highlighted team I chose to color in white as well as waiting to draw it until after the other lines have been drawn.
This gives the benefit of having a much higher color value than the other lines making it pop, as well as making sure no other lines are covering important sections. 
The name of the team above the data is in white to match the highlight line, and offset from the edge of the border to give it visual clarity. 
Lastly there is an average line drawn in the darkest stroke color to designate what a 50% win percentage would be position wise.
